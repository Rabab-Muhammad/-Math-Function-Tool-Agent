# Math Tool Agent 🤖🧮


## Overview 📝
A powerful AI-powered math agent that can perform various mathematical operations using function tools. This agent leverages Google's Gemini AI model to understand natural language queries and execute appropriate mathematical calculations.


## Features ✨

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands math questions phrased in everyday language
- **Multiple Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Error Handling: Includes** protection against division by zero errors
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface for asking math questions
- **Automated Testing**: Comes with built-in test cases to verify functionality


## Mathematical Operations ➕➖✖️➗

1. The agent can perform the following operations:
2. Addition: Add two integers (add(a, b))
3. Subtraction: Subtract one integer from another (subtract(a, b))
4. Multiplication: Multiply two integers (multiply(a, b))
5. Division: Divide two numbers with zero-division protection (divide(a, b))

## Usage 💻
1. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py

2. The application will first run automated tests with sample questions:

"What is 15 plus 23?"

"Multiply 8 and 7 for me"

"If I have 100 apples and I give away 35, how many do I have left?"

3. After testing, you can ask your own math questions

4. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the session.
